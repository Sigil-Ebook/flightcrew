zipios++/zipios_defs.h was modified to use include the boost cstdint.hpp header
so that the uint16 and uint32 types can be declared to something sensible on a
64 bit operating system. The previous values were wrong.

zipios++/zipios-config.h was created and it now includes the zipios-config.unix.h
or zipios-config.w32.h headers based on the platform.
