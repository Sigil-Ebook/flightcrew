FlightCrew is a C++, cross-platform, native code epub validator. It is composed of three parts:
  * FlightCrew, the validation library;
  * FlightCrew-cli, the command-line front-end to the FlightCrew library;
  * FlightCrew-gui, the GUI front-end to the FlightCrew library;

FlightCrew runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X (and possibly other platforms). FlightCrew-gui uses the Qt Framework, but the rest does not. The validation library has **no** external dependencies outside of those included in the source tree and built along with FlightCrew.

Since FlightCrew is licensed under LGPLv3, it can be directly used by closed-source projects as well as open-source ones. It was initially created for [Sigil](http://code.google.com/p/sigil/), the epub editor.

Work on FlightCrew was inspired by the inadequacies of other epub checkers.
